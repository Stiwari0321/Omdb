Assignment 5: Movie List Application with OMDB API Integration

Objective: Develop a movie list application inspired by IMDB that uses the OMDB API. The application should allow users to view a list of movies with their posters and names. It should include pagination for movie lists exceeding 15 entries, a search text box to find movies directly from the API, and a movie details section that displays additional information fetched from the API upon clicking a movie. Additionally, users should be able to provide ratings (out of 5 stars) and comments for each movie, and this data should be saved in the local storage.

Instructions:

Account Setup:
Create an account on the OMDB API website: https://www.omdbapi.com/
Obtain the authorization key required for API access.

API Understanding:
Carefully review the documentation provided by OMDB API.
Gain a comprehensive understanding of how the API functions and explore the available endpoints along with the parameters they accept.

HTML Page Creation:
Develop an HTML page that serves as the movie list application.
Display a list of movies, each showing the movie's poster and name.

Pagination:
Implement pagination functionality for movie lists with more than 15 entries.
Display previous and next buttons for navigation between pages.
Show page numbers for easy navigation.

Search Functionality:
Integrate a search text box that allows users to directly search for movies using the OMDB API.
Utilize the available data to provide search results in real-time as users type their search query.

Movie Details Section:
Create a movie details section that can be accessed by clicking on a movie from the list.
Retrieve additional movie information from the OMDB API and display it in this section.

User Ratings and Comments:
Allow users to provide ratings for each movie on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
Implement a comment feature that enables users to leave comments about each movie.
Save the user ratings and comments in the local storage to persist the data across sessions.

Note: Ensure the application is visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive to different screen sizes. Implement error handling to handle potential API request failures and edge cases. Thoroughly test the application to verify its functionality and address any potentialÂ issues.
